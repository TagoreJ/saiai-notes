## Principles:
- hurdle rate:  expected rate of return: higher for riskier projects, lower for not riskier projects.
- Financing mix should minimizes the hurdle rate and matches the assets being financed
- Dividends must be given if there is no opportunity to grow.

###  A Good Risk Model:
- measure of risk, applies to all assets
- standardized risk measures.
- translate risk involved with a rate of return
- works not only to talk abt the past returns but also in predicting future expected returns.
